I will pay more attention next time.', b'The stattic build should trigger and verify the script to see if it is working.', b""@wkcn Static build CPU 14.04 Python and Static build CPU 14.04 Scala in ubuntu cpu have tested against the script. I just want to make sure it also works in ubuntu 16.04. Since we're still using ubuntu 14.04 to build the package so no worry. Thanks for your hard work""]",closed,4/4/2019 23:07,4/10/2019 12:01,12
