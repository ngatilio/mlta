Why are you pinning Pillow to a specific version? Wouldn't it be better going forward to use Pillow without specifying the version number?

', b'@joschu how does this PR look?', b'@joschu thanks for the merge!\r\n\r\nAny chance we can get a 0.18.1 release with this update? My Component Governance system is very angry at my current Pillow version...', b'Not sure how to do this. @pzhokhov ?', b""> Not sure how to do this. @pzhokhov ?\r\n\r\ntypically, this would require simply making a git tag with new version and pushing it, CI would do the rest. However, the build is failing currently, I'll look into fixing it."", b'ok so the story is a bit tangled here - the build is broken because we are using relatively old patch versions of python (3.6.8 and 3.7.3); somehow, builds timeout when trying to pull docker images for those. When using newer patch versions that are actually listed on python dockerhub repo page (3.6.13 and 3.7.10), things seem to work, however, then mujoco segfaults.  We could move forward without mujoco tests (I made a PR: https://github.com/openai/gym/pull/2220/files), which will let us release newer versions. Otherwise, more investigation is needed into how to make mujoco work with newer versions of python. Thoughts @joschu @christopherhesse ? ', b""Another approach could be to make our own public mirror for old python images, say, on ACR. OTOH, finicky properties of mujoco wrt python versions are a really sore spot, I'd rather we did not propagate that madness further. "", b""For the reference, here's how a build that fails to pull python 3.6.8 image from dockerhub looks like: https://www.travis-ci.org/github/openai/gym/jobs/766940827"", b""@pzhokhov \r\nStarted getting a lot of safety warnings due to Pillow, and the old pin from gym.\r\nIf we can not get a new release up onto pypi, I am going to need to roll gym out of my team's project. Any active work or ETA on 18.0.1?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9027725/116911156-7825d200-ac14-11eb-9ec1-7a2ddbe71ac9.png)\r\n\r\n""]",closed,3/10/2021 1:42,4/6/2021 15:18,32
