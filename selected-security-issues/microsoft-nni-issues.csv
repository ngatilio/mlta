So I mainly wanted a a pypi official release they could upgrade to (https://pypi.org/project/nni/#history) Am I right in thinking the nightly builds are not in pypi?\r\n\r\nAlso am I right to assume that Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) (https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report) can assign a CVE to this issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n', b'@snoopysecurity thanks, got the scenario.
