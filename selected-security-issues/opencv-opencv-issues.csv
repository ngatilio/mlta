Such interfaces should be polished accurately:\r\n- minimal ""required"" set of parameters.\r\n- easily extendable interface\r\n- usability (construct image decoder, call readHeader(), check result and then maybe get image size via width and height - this long story we should to hide from users)\r\n\r\nPerhaps, we could start with simple set of functions, for example:\r\n```\r\n/** Query image parameters\r\n\r\n@sa cv::imread\r\n\r\nThrows exception if image is not supported.\r\n\r\n@param filename Name of file to be loaded\r\n@param flags Flag that can take values of cv::ImreadModes\r\n@param[out] type (optional) type of decoded cv::Mat returned by cv::imtead\r\n@param[out] decoderName (optional) name of used image decoder for cv::imread\r\n@returns size of image\r\n*/\r\nSize imquery(const cv::String& filename, int flags = IMREAD_COLOR,\r\n                CV_OUT int* type = NULL, CV_OUT cv::String* decoderName = NULL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe it is able to handle declared set of problems from the PR description.', b""@alalek , IMHO\r\n\r\n- nextPage() can't be ignored as just redundand for nowadays we're able to handle multipage TIFF images;\r\n- I hope imageHeader/width and imageHeader/height still can be a subject for a discussion;\r\n\r\nI think the case could be mantained for the imgcodecs to be more clean. Nowadays the only what a imgcodecs' user can is try to load the image via, say, imread and check the retval. But in the prod code it's just sort of gambling with user's memory (i.e. working set) - every try to load image, say, 10000x10000 or even bigger leads to a memory consumption peak with empty retval.\r\n\r\nAm I right that you prefer not to add struct/classes?\r\nThe another way to mantain the case could be code like that:\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n@param filename Name of file to be loaded\r\n@param flags Flag that can take values of cv::ImreadModes\r\n@param[out] type (optional) type of decoded cv::Mat returned by cv::imread\r\n@param[out] width (optional) width of decoded cv::Mat returned by cv::imread\r\n@param[out] height (optional) width of decoded cv::Mat returned by cv::imread\r\n*/\r\nCV_EXPORTS_W bool imreadheader(const String& filename, int flags, \r\n                                CV_OUT int* type = NULL, CV_OUT int* width = NULL, CV_OUT int* height = NULL);\r\n\r\n/**\r\n^like the previous\r\n*/\r\nstruct ImageSize // or pair_of_int or tuple_of_int\r\n{\r\nint width;\r\nint height;\r\n};\r\nCV_EXPORTS_W bool imreadheadermulti(const String& filename, int flags, \r\n                                CV_OUT int* type = NULL, CV_OUT std::vector<ImageSize>* sizes = NULL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for mentioned imquery() - yes, it gives you the option to distinguish JPEG from TIFF, but the image size is an open question still - so you basically don't know if there any way to load it.\r\n\r\nP.S. @brian-armstrong-discord I apologize for I've just mentioned yet another interface for the case.

To enable throwing means just to break the backward compatibility and previously written error handling. \r\nP.P.P.S. Yup, both imreadheader() and imquery() aren't so good regarding the perf - on imread() you eventually reread the header.

Upgrade to the latest version first. It is better to avoid 3.4.x releases in new projects due to ancient Android NDK r10 dependency.\r\n2. Almost all 3rdparty libraries are optional (but disable some functionality of OpenCV library)\r\n3. Check getBuildInformation() / CMake output for exact versions. Also check [Android pack](http://pullrequest.opencv.org/buildbot/builders/master_pack-android) builder logs.\r\n4.

But we are not directly using the opencv in our project.

But most of them are enabled by default, especially on Android. Some dependencies will be enabled only on specific platforms, e.g. _carotene_ on ARM or _ippicv_ on x86_64. \r\nSo you should consult with your OpenCV SDK provider - actual configuration depends on options used for the build.

The mistake that exists directly in the referenced source code\nis an attempt to assign the value of -1 to an unsigned integer (pos).\nThis causes pos to have a huge positive value. Then, ""i = cstr_ + pos""\ncauses i to be an invalid pointer, and *i is an invalid pointer\ndereference that causes a crash.\n\nHowever, the original problem might be elsewhere in the\nopencv_annotation source code. You are reporting that the value of\ncstr_ is 0x0. In that situation, find_last_of should not have been\ncalled at all, regardless of whether find_last_of was correctly\nimplemented. If cstr_ is 0x0, find_last_of would typically be\nsearching in memory locations that have small positive values (e.g.,\nmemory location 1), and this is obviously not useful. The original\nproblem that you discovered may be a cv::String object that\nunintentionally was constructed with 0x0 as both the len_ value and\nthe cstr_ value.\n\nThe ""berak"" example of:\n\n   cv::String s = """"; //empty\n\nmay help to illustrate the source-code problem; however, it is unclear\nwhether any possible use of the opencv_annotation program would result\nin a cv::String object where cstr_ was nonzero but len_ was zero.\n\nThus, we can divide this into two cases, A and B.\n\nA. Your discovery is a chain of issues in which:\n1. cstr_ is, for an unknown reason, equal to 0x0 but find_last_of is\n    called anyway\n2. because len_ is also 0x0, there is an incorrect attempt to associate -1\n    with an unsigned data type\n3. this later leads to an invalid pointer dereference\n\nUse CVE-2015-5710 to refer to the vulnerability defined by this chain\nof issues.\n\nB. The ""berak"" discovery shows a source-code error, but it is not\n   known whether this error is reachable during use of the\n   opencv_annotation program. Thus, the ""berak"" discovery does not\n   currently have a CVE ID. If there is future research that\n   identifies a call to find_last_of in which len_ is 0x0 but cstr_ is\n   not 0x0, then that case could have a different CVE ID.\n\n---\n\nCVE assignment team\n', b'once the String::find_last_of issue gets fixed, glob() tries to get smart, if given an empty folder string, and tries to search the current dir (""."") . it would still need a default for the txtfile.\n\n@StevenPuttemans , maybe you could use the CmdLineParser:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/berak/53d1c0f1c67074168789\n\ndrawback is the different syntax: `annotate --images=some/path/ --annotation=my.txt`  (which is not very intuitive) , but at least this makes sure there\'s a valid folder and a sensible default for the textfile (also it won\'t get fooled by dummy params like in the issue above)\n\nlast, but not least, it might need checking the imread() output (there might be non-images in the path)\n', b'@alaamub @berak \nif I understand it correctly, the only time stuff like this is happening is when people supply wrong parameters? How does train_cascade or create_samples cope with that then? Because that seems to be identical.\n\nFor me, if this is pure the case of people needing to pay attention, then I am not really up to changing the complete interface. The syntax is now straightforward and identical for all tools.\n\nAs for\n--> checking the input, seems fair and reasonable\n--> checking if the path actually exists on the system can be done also\n\nWill apply those fixes asap!\n', b'As i mentioned in the post earlier, two issues need to be tackled here,\n1. cstr_ is, for an unknown reason, equal to 0x0 but find_last_of is called anyway (you may need to fix this)\n2. because len_ is also 0x0, there is an incorrect attempt to associate -1 with an unsigned data type (making len_ 0x0 makes the unsigned ""pos"" negative and that leads to the crash and this is something you need to fix) so check for the length first to avoid ""pos"" to be negative. and then check to see why cstr_ for an unknown reason is equal to 0x0. you can also implement the two things you mentioned (checking the input, checking if the path actually exists). thanks \n', b'Like you can see, I added checks for a correct input image read, the existance of the folder and the fact that the output stream is actually created or not. This for both 2.4 and master branch!\n', b'this should make it to work, once you release it i will test it again . thanks \n', b'All bugfixes seem processed, lets wait and see if it gets merged now :)\n', b'Both fixes were merged, so this can be closed down.\n', b'Thanks.\n']",closed,7/31/2015 17:56,8/10/2015 17:04,26
