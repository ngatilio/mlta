The issue quotes CVE-2020-14147.\r\n\r\nAccording to the folks at Gentoo, it's fixed as of Redis 5.0.9:\xc2\xa0https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-17\r\nAnd according to Debian, it's fixed upstream in 5.0.8:\xc2\xa0https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-14147\r\n(Specifically by commit: https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/ef764dde1cca2f25d00686673d1bc89448819571)\r\n\r\nWe have 5.0.9 in 1.0.1, 1.0.0, and 0.8.7: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/releases/1.0.0/bazel/ray_deps_setup.bzl -- even by the issue's own statement.\r\n\r\nNow, to be fair, our Windows version currently lags. So we could bump that relatively painlessly, even for 1.0.1 -- 5.0.9 is available.\r\n\r\nLua is used to build redis, sure, but we don't use it directly, and c-ares -- for resolving addresses -- is also not a direct dependency, but in both cases I welcome finding the dependency we might need to bump. \r\n\r\nSo this hasn't truly been a problem this whole time, and we can bump Redis at our leisure.\r\n"", b"">So this hasn't truly been a problem this whole time, and we can bump Redis at our leisure.\r\n\r\n@barakmich I am disappointed that this is your response, it is not an attitude that is friendly to enterprise users. Enterprise users are very sensitive to security issues, and, by extension, Ray developers will need to be sensitive too if enterprise adoption is expected. I am sure it is a big ask to update the Redis dependency, but we cannot suggest to our customers to use Ray when there are known vulnerabilities in the Redis version.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter if other groups have found that the vulnerabilities don't affect the version of Redis Ray depends on, it is in NVD as <6.0.3 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14147). As long as it continues to be flagged as a vulnerability in BDBA, we cannot recommend Ray to customers or release tools and products that build on Ray. \r\n\r\nTo be clear, we opened this issue so that we can recommend Ray to enterprise customers. Until these CVEs are resolved, we cannot. "", b""Hey just to recap this conversation: \r\n\r\nIt seems like from a purely technical perspective, Ray has a different threat model than Redis, so a RCE vulnerability for Redis isn't a a dealbreaker (since the attacker that can connect to Redis would have a much easier time executing remote code by connecting as a Ray driver). \r\n\r\nUsing an old version of Redis _is_ still a problem though because from a compliance perspective, downstream patches are not recognized by NVD. Therefore, we could think of upgrading to Redis >= 6.0.3 as a high priority enterprise compliance feature? \r\n\r\n@devin-petersohn @barakmich does this sound right? "", b'> Therefore, we could think of upgrading to Redis >= 6.0.3 as a high priority enterprise compliance feature?\r\n@wuisawesome Thanks, that will solve the problem.', b""@wuisawesome +1 to upgrading to Redis >= 6.0.3 to unblock our enterprise users. Maybe we should break out upgrading Redis as a separate issue for tracking since we've already got #11371 in progress. Perhaps I was hasty earlier; my focus was on the security risks to Ray's users and didn't account for enterprise requirements.\r\n\r\nTo be clear for the community; this vulnerability (CVE-2020-14147) is not present in current Ray and has not been since 2020-07-03 nightly or release [0.8.6](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/releases/tag/ray-0.8.6).\r\n\r\nHere is the work we did to support that conclusion:\r\n\r\nQ: When was this vulnerability fixed in Redis?:\r\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14147\r\n   * Has references to the pull request that fixes this: https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/6875\r\n   * And the specific commit that does as well: https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/ef764dde1cca2f25d00686673d1bc89448819571\r\n* This patch was backported to the 5.0 release branch on 2020-02-10.\r\n   * Specifically this commit that exists in the 5.0.8 and 5.0.9 release branch: https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/16b2d07f0a9b58027611dab7f97788d37cb5ab84\r\n* The release SHAs that contain that commit in Redis are:\r\n   * 5.0.8: https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/1f7d08b76dc83fd2aa43ee7fc04ab4ee01016628\r\n   * 5.0.9: https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/ce878b6ed5df1a7b3e87a8af2d1262de4c5bb828\r\n\r\nQ: How about Ray?\r\n* Ray was updated to build against Redis 5.0.9 on 2020-07-02\r\n   * https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/a8e4ddbd57f2cdc9a274138904a8857f8427dc39\r\n* Before that it was on 5.0.3 -- which may still be vulnerable.\r\n\r\nQ: How do we know Ray built the right Redis?\r\n* In the above commit, the SHA256 of the 5.0.9 source used was db9bf149e237126f9bb5f40fb72f33701819555d06f16e9a38b4949794214201 which matches the reported sha256sum of https://github.com/antirez/redis/archive/5.0.9.tar.gz (as of time of writing).\r\n* We can look in that archive and verify that the sha256 of the file inside matches that needed to fix the vulnerability:\r\n    * From the git commit referenced in 5.0.9 (ce878b6):\r\n       * `57bc18e91a747a846ba76c070d9213452283c0ed9e652861ee7fabf87d590878  deps/lua/src/lua_struct.c`\r\n    * From the tarball with the exact sha256 that ray built against:\r\n       * `57bc18e91a747a846ba76c070d9213452283c0ed9e652861ee7fabf87d590878  deps/lua/src/lua_struct.c`\r\n   * Commit from the NIST page (ef764dde1cca2f25d00686673d1bc89448819571):\r\n       * `57bc18e91a747a846ba76c070d9213452283c0ed9e652861ee7fabf87d590878  deps/lua/src/lua_struct.c`"", b'>To be clear for the community; this vulnerability (CVE-2020-14147) is not present in current Ray and has not been since 2020-07-03 nightly or release 0.8.6.\r\n\r\nThis has not been independently verified by NIST. The links on the NVD are there for information only and are links to third party resources. It should be up to the user whether to accept these third party opinions, and we should be careful not to obfuscate the fact that NIST has this CVE classified as up to (excluding) Redis 6.0.3, which means Ray is currently vulnerable (scroll to the bottom of the [page](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14147#vulnConfigurationsArea) to see it). We do not yet know if the only changes necessary to fix the vulnerability are those found in the PR, NIST is currently reanalyzing the CVE.\r\n\r\n**According to the NVD this vulnerability is still present in Ray.** \r\n\r\nI do not think we should close this issue in favor of opening an issue for tracking an update to Redis.

Redis uses Lua for some stuff, so it must have something to do with Redis."", b'@robertnishihara @zhe-thoughts The tool scans the binary and its dependencies, and as the Lua is a dynamic library loaded by redis-server and is a part of the Redis package dependencies, it triggers the scan and the list of vulnerabilities. Look for the file liblua.so and links liblua.so.5.1, liblua.so.5.1.5. It also could be installed in your build dependencies on a system level.\r\n\r\nOutput from the tool \r\n-----------------------\r\nCurrent version - 5.1.5 OUTDATED\r\nLatest version - 5.4.1\r\nCVE-2020-15889\r\nCVE-2020-24342\r\nCVE-2020-15888\r\nCVE-2014-5461\r\nCVE-2020-15945\r\n\r\nSo if you are not actively using it, then just the upgrade of the version should be sufficient.
