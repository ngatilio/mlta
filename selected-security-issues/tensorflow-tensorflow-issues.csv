https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20280,b'Provide a way to build a Tensorflow wheel without a dependency on Tensorboard',"[b""Hi, @orf. I don't believe that TensorBoard will ever be separated from TensorFlow. The TensorFlow team has worked hard to keep the package small in size, and they want TensorFlow to come with a nice visualization tool.\r\n\r\nPlease see tensorflow#12567. It doesn't solve your question, but it may be useful in deciding how to continue."", b'Hey @marshalhayes, thank you for your quick reply. Let me just elaborate a bit.\r\n\r\nI have no problem with Tensorboard being bundled with the default Tensorflow package but in the context of a server environment specifically I\'ve elaborated on a few issues below. I only ask for the idea that when building a *custom* Tensorflow package the *option* is given to disable the dependency link somehow.\r\n\r\n1. The current stable tensorflow, via tensorboard, pulls in vulnerable versions of `html5lib` and `bleach`, in the case of `html5lib` there is a CVE from 2016 (`CVE-2016-9909`). This causes headaches with compliance - ""yes sir we are indeed running vulnerable data sanitization packages with known CVEs, but trust us it\'s not used. we swear"".\r\n\r\n2. These sub dependencies can cause conflicts in a server environment, especially with bleach and htm5lib, but also with werkzeug and markdown.\r\n\r\n3. Python packaging itself is a headache, and if you use something like pipenv it\'s not easy or even supported to exclude a subdependency in the way we want. Running `pip uninstall xyz` afterwards is a hack at best and one only exclusively used for this situation. Not great.\r\n\r\nAll of these are exacerbated in my mind as Tensorboard is not used *or* required in the situations we are using it. As we are building a custom Tensorflow package that matches our CPU features I would simply love a build flag to disable the dependency link.', b'Nagging Assignee @michaelisard: It has been 14 days with no activity and this issue has an assignee. Please update the label and/or status accordingly.', b""This would be an opportunity to create two packages: tensorflow-core, which only installs tensorflow (and which may in fact result in some tensorflow python endpoints not working) and tensorflow (which is a virtual package that has dependencies on tensorflow-core and tensorboard. In the future, we may split tensorflow-core into more packages.\r\n\r\nI am not fundamentally opposed to this, but \r\n\r\n* there haven't been terribly compelling reasons (beyond uninstalling after installing, there are other [ugly methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33441033/pip-install-to-custom-target-directory-and-exclude-specific-dependencies) to exclude dependencies during installation)\r\n* some functionality in TensorFlow does depend on TensorBoard. All of the imports are guarded and should not lead to defects beyond the actual things that won't work, but we'd like to distribute a fully functional version. This can be fixed/minimized further.\r\n\r\nMost importantly though, I am hesitant to offer another package that people will come to depend on for a fixed set of functionality. For example, I wouldn't want people to get used to tensorflow-core coming with Estimators. We're in the process of separating tf.estimator into its own package. In the future, more such splits may happen (kernel libraries, ops libraries), and I think the exact dependency tree of all those packages needs to be an implementation detail. Maybe that's ok by calling them tensorflow_private_seekrit_kernels_do_not_depend_directly_on_this, but I think depending directly on this is exactly what you want to do.\r\n\r\nI think a tensorflow-server-only package which only contains what you need to run a tensorflow server is really what you want? As in, none of the Python API either?"", b""> This would be an opportunity to create two packages: tensorflow-core, which only installs tensorflow (and which may in fact result in some tensorflow python endpoints not working) and tensorflow (which is a virtual package that has dependencies on tensorflow-core and tensorboard. In the future, we may split tensorflow-core into more packages.\r\n\r\nI think this might be going too far, all I'm asking for is a `TENSORFLOW_DONT_INCLUDE_TENSORBOARD` bazel config option or something to just remove it from the build `setup.py`. Nothing too complex. Splitting them like you suggest does sound like a good idea in theory, but as you said it can come with problems. For now just allow us to remove a dependency if we so require. \r\n\r\nYou distribute Tensorflow as a lowest common denominator binary. Ok, that's fine and makes sense. So we should build it ourselves for our specific CPU features when running it at any scale. Ok, that's also fine and makes sense. But we should always always always include Tensorboard as a dependency? That's not fine, especially when it leads to conflicting dependencies and those dependencies have known CVE's against them.\r\n\r\nI'd love to switch to tensorflow-server, and I'm pushing for it, but... you know. Time.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, the new Tensorflow release (congratulations!) [triggers a defect in the `pipenv` dependency resolver](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2596). The culprit? ... `tensorboard` (and a non-backtracking resolver). Please let me remove this from our custom builds without having to resort to horrible `sed` post build hacks."", b""Yeah, that's reasonable. @yifeif do you have a sense of how easy this is to achieve using bazel? I suppose we could give setup.py a flag which we set using some bazel option, or something. \r\n\r\nOr, we could simply add a flag to setup.py, and you execute setup.py bdist_wheel yourself? That's definitely feasible and looks easy to do.\r\n\r\nI've added contributions welcome if you want to propose a specific way to do it."", b'That should be possible. We are already using [flags](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds/pip.sh#L195) to enable/disable things in setup.py for nightly. Is that something you are looking for @orf?', b""Yep, that's exactly what I am looking for. Thanks!\r\n\r\nMaybe this is a separate ticket but customizing the name of the package via a bazel flag would be awesome as well. Currently I am relying on a particular bash script that is sourced before `setup.py` is executed to overwrite a bash variable in the script that calls it.\r\n\r\nI'm currently a bit short on time but I will try and propose a PR to do both, if that is OK?"", b'That sounds good, thanks!', b'Please remove the assignee, as this issue is inviting external contributions. Otherwise, remove the `contributions welcome` label. Thank you.']",open,6/25/2018 16:36,,20
