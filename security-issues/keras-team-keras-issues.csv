https://api.github.com/repos/keras-team/keras/issues/15020,b'jQuery vulnerability',"[b""Hi @ryemack , Keras is a python project and JQuery is a javascript library. So, we're not sure why exactly your scan is saying Keras uses JQuery at all?"", b""@tomerk , I was wondering the same thing at first, and agree with you that it doesn't make sense. But, I did a file search on your project (looking at 2.4.0 tag), and did see the keras/docs/theme/js/jquery-2.1.1.min.js file, which is what makes Keras throw a level 9 security violation when using Nexus IQ scanning. \r\n\r\nAlso, I am a bit confused by another thing. When I do the same search on master I do not see the jquery-2.1.1.min.js file (or any jQuery file). I'm probably being an idiot and missing something, but regardless of that probability, Nexus IQ is throwing the vulnerability warning... I'm kinda at a loss to be honest."", b'Hmm yeah that seems pretty strange.\r\nThe most recent iteration of keras-io (where maybe ""docs/"" was coming from) does not appear to have jquery scripts in the ""theme"" directory: \r\nhttps://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/tree/master/theme\r\n\r\nWhen searching for ""jquery"" in the keras-team organization: I do see that jquery file in the legacy contrib_docs (the 2.1.1 jquery version):\r\nhttps://github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib/tree/3fc5ef709e061416f4bc8a92ca3750c824b5d2b0/contrib_docs/theme/js\r\n\r\nSo maybe it did use to get packaged w/ older versions of keras (including maybe 2.4.3), but I don\'t know that it would be getting packaged now in 2.6 & newer.\r\n\r\nSo, closing this issue for now.']",closed,2021-07-28 22:57:49,2021-08-14 23:44:26
