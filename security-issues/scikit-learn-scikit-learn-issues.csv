Changing it likely leads the program to overshoot indexing in an array somewhere. For ref, there are 7 SVs for class `0`."", b'It should not segfault but fail gracefully.', b""The snippet above is changing a *private* attribute (it has a leading underscore).\r\n\r\nBy definition, these aren't supposed to be changed by the user. When they're used by the estimator, it's fair to assume that they are properly set to a correct value.\r\n\r\nWe can't safe-guard against every single misuse, and this is a misuse."", b'Consider the common scenario when a model is trained in a research machine and then transfered for production use to live environment, if a malicious actor is able to take a hold of the model and change it,  it should not be able to trigger a segmentation fault, please bear in mind the segfaults may have security implications other than crashing the process.', b""> if a malicious actor\r\n\r\nThis is where it's out of scope here: we can't guard against everything. We have a responsibility to provide safe code when that code is used under the limits of what's a normal use-case, but that's pretty much it. Private attributes shouldn't be modified, and it's up to users to make sure that the estimator isn't maliciously altered.\r\n\r\nI might go on a limb and use a poor analogy but when I buy a car, I can't complain that it breaks if I replace the steering wheel by a potato.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to prevent segfaults, maybe you can intercept the `SIGSEGV`?"", b'To reuse you example: If someone switches the steering wheel for a potato, the car should not completelly break/fail unrecoverably the moment you turn it on and if it happens it would be considered a security risk would it no? You would not just say the driver to wear a helmet instead or would you?', b'Pickles are unsafe in any case. If you submit a pull request to avoid the\nsegfault we can consider it.\n', b'There are other ways to export a model which are not via pickle, and this does not require pickle at all.', b'> This is where it\'s out of scope here: we can\'t guard against everything.\r\n\r\nIsn\'t the model loader improperly validating the model and then segfaulting?  Is pickle the only way to load a model?\r\n\r\nThe proof of concept exploit code is just using the private attribute to shorten the example.  Perhaps it should have used a comment there describing ""loading a model with a modified n value""?  \r\n\r\nThis high CVE score is tripping up people trying to use scikit learn in regulated and secure environments.  ', b'>  This high CVE score is tripping up people trying to use scikit learn in regulated and secure environments.\r\n\r\nHmm, yes https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28975 and those are really used for enterprise deployment. We could do a bit more sanity checks in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/b43f057b22dead2e98669b8f7931eaf86d24b1d1/sklearn/svm/_libsvm.pyx#L279 to make that CVE go await, even if it would be difficult to be fully fail proof. A PR would be welcome.']",closed,2020-11-21 14:40:29,2021-10-20 12:30:06
