Do we need to revert the PR, since the CI has been passed?', b""@wkcn the previous CI failures don't seem to be related to this. There is CI test for building the static library which dependes on this (I'm not sure if the CI has tests specifically for this dependency though). In any case, it doesn't seem like a revert is urgently necessary right now."", b'@szha Thank you! I will pay more attention next time.', b'The stattic build should trigger and verify the script to see if it is working.', b""@wkcn Static build CPU 14.04 Python and Static build CPU 14.04 Scala in ubuntu cpu have tested against the script. I just want to make sure it also works in ubuntu 16.04. Since we're still using ubuntu 14.04 to build the package so no worry. Thanks for your hard work""]",closed,4/4/2019 23:07,4/10/2019 12:01
