https://api.github.com/repos/automl/auto-sklearn/issues/1345,b'Update Dask & Distributed to 2021.12.0',"[b""@mfeurer , I was going to delete this branch as it won't pass as is. It's failing because the pattern used for matching requirements doesn't reognize `<=` as a possible operation [here](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn/blob/master/autosklearn/util/__init__.py#L5).\r\n\r\nWe also don't allow the operation [here](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn/blob/master/autosklearn/util/dependencies.py#L48).\r\n\r\nWe should probably look into upgrading dask at some point anywho but I think this PR can be deleted and we fix these things separately."", b""Hi, one of the developers of Upgradvisor of here.\r\n\r\nWe tested this upgrade locally by installing using `pip install == 2021.12.0`  and didn't expect the change in the requirements file having such a deep effect on automl's code.\r\n\r\n@eddiebergman - sorry for the inconvenience, I do hope this output will help (and maybe nudge :) ) your efforts to upgrade dask. \r\n\r\nWill close the PR."", b'Hi @Yanivmd , thanks for the personal response. We do some extra steps due to the kinds of shared environments our users sometimes have when using this library, the extra output can help them debug things.\r\n\r\nCool bot by the way, looking forward to seeing what future progress you make!\r\n\r\n\r\n ']",closed,2021-12-11 22:45:09,2021-12-12 17:04:06
